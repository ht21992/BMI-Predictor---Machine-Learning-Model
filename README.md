BMI Prediction ModelThis is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) machine learning model that predicts body status based on gender, height, and weight inputs.


The predicted body status categories are:

```
 - 0: Extremely weak,
 - 1: Weak,
 - 2: Normal,
 - 3: Overweight,
 - 4: Obesity,
 - 5: Extremely Obesity

```
